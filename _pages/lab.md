The Intel Autonomous Agents Lab strives to advance the capabilities of autonomous and intelligent systems by proposing new solutions in the areas of machine learning, simulation for AI, computer vision, computer graphics, policy learning, and 3D geometry, among others. Our team targets high-impact projects that typically result in strong scientific publications in top-tier conferences, and influential open-source projects, widely used by large communities of industry and academic users.

We are currently obsessed with the creation of new technologies to advance the capabilities of AI agents through simulation, and meta realities. If you are interested in the research themes carried out in the Autonomous Agents Lab and would like to know more, please reach out to the e-mail address below. We have open positions for research scientists and research engineers. We also host interns all year round.
